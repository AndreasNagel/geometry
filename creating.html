<h1> Creating a geometry scheme</h1>

<p>Creating a scheme can be divided into 4 steps: </p>
<ul>
<li>Choosing the blocks.</li>
<li>Setting the input values</li>
<li>Setting the relations</li>
<li>Choosing the output value</li>
</ul>

<p>You can choose the blocks from a toolbar above, use as many and as different as needed. To place a shape on the scheme click on the desired shape on toolbar and then to place it anywhere on the scheme, click on the scheme.
</p>

<p>You can set the input values by double clicking on a shape, or by right clicking and selecting properties. Once the properties window is open you can set the desired value by writing a value behind it's letter. Do not check the input checkbox behind the value, this will cause the program to ask the value from you upon running the scheme (which is of course allowed but most of the times not needed).
</p>

<p>To set the relations between objects on the scheme, we need to use the relation tool on the toolbar. Click on it once and click on a port on the scheme. Connect the port to another port on the scheme. Voil√° the second object is now gets one of it's values from the first object. If one size is multiplied by another you can use the multiplier block or a different relation tool, which allows setting a multiplier by which the value of the port is multiplied before the value is passed on to the second port.
</p>

<p>
</p>

<p>The easiest way to set the output is to place the "equals" block on the scheme and connecting it to the desired output. The other way to set an output is to open up the properties of an object (double click on it) and manually checking the output checkbox of the value to be calculated.
</p>

<p>When the output value is calculated, no more calculations are executed.</p>
