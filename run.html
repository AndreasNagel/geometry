<h1> Running the scheme</h1>

<p>To run the scheme and calculate the output, CoCoViLa needs sufficient amount of information to calculate the goal. If it does not have the variables needed, then the program will produce no meaningful information about the goal that was set.</p>

<p>To run the scheme, choose "Scheme" from the toolbar and select "Specification...". A window will open with some buttons and some code about the objects on scheme. Click on "Compute goal" to proceed. The following window will show you some more code and some buttons. If you check the "Propagate" checkbox, then the results calculated will also be provided to the objects on the scheme. If not, then the results will only be visible in the same window after clicking "Compile & Run". Click on "Compile & Run" to run to see the calculation results.</p>

<p>The following tab will show the variables CoCoViLa has calcualted. Each variable starts with the name of the object on the scheme and after the dot it says which one of it's variables was calculated. If you click propagate values, the values will still appear on the scheme even, if you did not check the "Propagate" checkbox in the previous tab.</p>

<p>The final tab also has a chance to run the scheme again by clicking the "Invoke" button. The "Invoke New" button can be particularly useful if you have checked some variables as inputs. Then the program will ask for new variables before every run, which allows to quickly calculate the results of a scheme with different values.
