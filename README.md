# geometry
This is a simple geometry package including circle, square, rectangle, triangle and trapezoid shapes. It should be able to calculate different values on the shapes given that the scheme is provided a sufficient amount of variables. To make calculations easier on scheme operators for addition, subtraction, multiplication and divisions are added. There is also and extra relation class, which allows to multiply a value and pass it to another place.

This package is easy enough to test and get the basic idea what the CoCoViLa program is and how it works.
The ports on shapes can be connected with a binding relation or simply by placing two ports on top of one another.
There is also the operator to give out the result of the scheme. It is intended to have an input value, which comes from the scheme, and is marked as output.
